# RFC 6- Allow staff engineers and senior managers to edit components
* Comments: [#6](https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-conduit/developer-productivity-rfcs/issues/6)
* Proposed by: @emceeaich

# Summary

Grant `editcomponents` to staff engineers, senior engineering manager in Bugzilla.

## Motivation

Because it's an administrative task we should trust our staff engineers 
and senior managers to get right. And it's work we should get off our plates
as Bugzilla administrators.

# Details

Creating a group on Bugzilla called component-managers and for now, adding people to it
by hand. At the moment, P. Lawless from the performance team is in the group. 

# Open Questions

* Should this be restricted further to a set of components or team?
* What's the worse that can happen?
* How can we automate who is in the group?

# Implementation

* <link to tracker bug, issue, etc.>
